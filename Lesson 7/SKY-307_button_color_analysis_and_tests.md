## Clarity Check

1. What is the exact green color code (hex/RGB/variable) to be used for the "Search Flight" button?
2. Which specific pages and components contain the "Search Flight" button and must be updated?
3. Should the color change apply to all button states (default, hover, active, disabled, focus)?
4. Are there any accessibility requirements (e.g., minimum contrast ratio, WCAG compliance)?
5. Are there any themes, A/B tests, or user roles that affect the button’s appearance?
6. Should automated visual regression tests be updated or added for this change?
7. Are there any backend or third-party dependencies that could affect the button rendering?
8. What is the expected behavior if the button fails to load the new style (e.g., fallback color, error logging)?
9. Is there a need to test on specific browsers, devices, or screen readers?
10. Will this change require regression testing of booking flows or other UI elements?

*Assumptions:*
- The green color will be provided by the design team or matches the design system.
- The change applies to all states of the "Search Flight" button.
- The button appears on all booking-related pages for all users.
- No backend or third-party dependencies affect the button rendering.
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) are required.
- No A/B tests or themes override the button color.
- Visual regression testing is required.
- The button should gracefully fall back to a default color if the style fails to load.
- All major browsers and devices are in scope.

## Detailed Analysis

**Actor:** End user (customer booking a ticket), UI/UX designer, QA engineer

**Goal:** Ensure the "Search Flight" button is visually prominent and accessible by changing its color to green across all relevant UI components.

**Preconditions:**  
- User is on a page where the "Search Flight" button is present.
- The application is using the latest UI codebase.

**Trigger:**  
- The user views a page with the "Search Flight" button.

**Main Flow:**
1. User navigates to a booking-related page.
2. The "Search Flight" button is displayed in green.
3. The button color is consistent across all states (default, hover, active, disabled, focus).
4. The button meets accessibility standards for contrast and visibility.

**Alternate Flows:**
- The button is disabled (e.g., required fields not filled).
- The button is displayed in a different theme or under A/B testing.

**Exception Flows:**
- The button fails to load the green style (e.g., missing CSS variable).
- The button is not visible due to a rendering or browser compatibility issue.

**Assumptions:**
- The green color is defined and available in the design system.
- All states and variants of the button are updated.
- No business logic changes are required—UI only.
- The button is not dynamically generated in a way that would prevent the style from applying.

## Test Cases

Feature: Search Flight Button Color Update

@High
Scenario: Search Flight button displays in green on main page
  Given the user navigates to main page
  When the page loads
  Then the "Search Flight" button should be displayed in the specified green color #008000

@High
Scenario: Search Flight button color is consistent across all states
  Given the user sees the "Search Flight" button
  When the user hovers, clicks, or disables the button
  Then the button color and style should match the design for each state and color #008000

@High
Scenario: Search Flight button meets accessibility standards
  Given the "Search Flight" button is visible
  When the user views the button on any supported device or browser
  Then the button should have sufficient color contrast per WCAG 2.1 AA

@Medium
Scenario: Search Flight button falls back to default color if green style fails to load
  Given the green color variable is missing or fails to load
  When the user views the "Search Flight" button
  Then the button should display a default color and not break the UI

@Medium
Scenario: Search Flight button is visible and styled correctly for all user roles and themes
  Given the user is logged in with any role or theme
  When the user navigates to a booking-related page
  Then the "Search Flight" button should be green and styled correctly

@Medium
Scenario: Visual regression test for Search Flight button
  Given the UI is updated
  When automated visual regression tests are run
  Then no unintended changes should be detected for the "Search Flight" button

@Low
Scenario: Search Flight button is accessible via screen readers
  Given the user is using a screen reader
  When the "Search Flight" button is focused
  Then the button should be announced correctly and be accessible

@Low
Scenario: Search Flight button renders correctly on all major browsers and devices
  Given the user accesses the site on any supported browser or device
  When the "Search Flight" button is displayed
  Then the button should appear green and function as expected

@Low
Scenario: Regression - Booking flow is not affected by button color change
  Given the user completes a booking flow
  When the "Search Flight" button is used
  Then the booking process should work as before, with no functional regressions
