### User Story:
FE - Change Book Ticket Button Color to Green

# The Why

To improve the visual clarity and call-to-action effectiveness, we want the 'Book Ticket' button to stand out more on the UI.

# The What

- Change the color of the 'Book Ticket' button to green across all relevant pages and components.
- Ensure the new color is consistent with the design system and accessible (sufficient contrast).
- Update any hover, active, or disabled states to match the new green color scheme.

# Design

Please refer to the latest Figma design or contact the design team for the exact green color code and states.

If you have questions or need additional assets, please reach out to the UI/UX team.

### Issues Found:
- No explicit acceptance criteria or Gherkin scenarios provided.
- "Relevant pages and components" is ambiguous‚Äîscope is not clearly defined.
- No specific green color code or reference to a design token.
- Accessibility requirements (contrast ratio, color blindness) are mentioned but not quantified.
- No mention of how to verify the change (e.g., visual regression, screenshots).
- No negative/edge case handling (e.g., what if the button is dynamically generated, themed, or disabled?).
- No rollback or regression impact analysis.
- No mention of environments or browser support requirements.
- No performance or security considerations stated.

### Clarification & Test Design Questions:
- Q1: Which exact pages and components contain the 'Book Ticket' button and must be updated? Is there a list or selector reference?
- Q2: What is the exact green color code (hex/RGB/variable) to be used? Should it match an existing design system token?
- Q3: What are the required contrast ratios or accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA) for the new button color?
- Q4: Should the color change apply to all button states (default, hover, active, disabled, focus)? Are there mockups for each?
- Q5: Are there any themes, A/B tests, or user roles that affect the button‚Äôs appearance?
- Q6: Should automated visual regression tests be updated or added for this change?
- Q7: Are there any backend or third-party dependencies that could affect the button rendering?
- Q8: What is the expected behavior if the button fails to load the new style (e.g., fallback color, error logging)?
- Q9: Is there a need to test on specific browsers, devices, or screen readers?
- Q10: Will this change require regression testing of booking flows or other UI elements?

### Suggested Test Scenarios:
- ‚úÖ Positive: Verify that the 'Book Ticket' button appears green with the correct color code on all specified pages and states (default, hover, active, disabled).
- ‚ùå Negative: Simulate a missing or incorrect color variable‚Äîverify fallback behavior and error handling.
- üîÅ Regression: Retest booking flows, UI themes, and any components that reuse the button to ensure no unintended style or functional regressions.
